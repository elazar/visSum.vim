It is something so trivial, I can't believe it hasn't been done before.
After looking for an hour I couldn't find a plugin to do this without relying on external programs, so here is my offering, 100% pure vimscript.

Highlight some lines containing numbers, and use <Leader>su (usually that's \su) and the sum appears in the message line.  

It works by grepping each line of your selection for the first number it sees, and adds that to the running total.

Visual Block support added in version 0.2.
